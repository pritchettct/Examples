# Examples
This repository holds examples of my work.
## loader.c
This is the code for the loader of the Y86 processor I am building for my Computer Systems 1 class.

## infinite_playlist.py
This program was originally created by my teacher for my music informatics class. It intakes a playlist of songs, compares their beats, and will jump around the playlist indefinitely.

In the original code, the jumps between beats were often somewhat abrupt and unsettling to listen to. I modified the code so that when there is a jump, a transition is created that fades the current and next beat together, so that the overall sound is much smoother.

## OutOfOrder.java
Unfortunately, I had many of my java programs (including my UNO AI) on a flash drive which I seem to have misplaced when I moved, but this is an example of a program I completed for my Data Structures class which compares the times for two different algorithms for computing the number of out-of-order pairs in an array.
